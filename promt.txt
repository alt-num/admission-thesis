I need you to fix the authentication models and auth configuration in this Laravel project.  
DO NOT create new models — only update the existing files.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- You must inspect the existing project files first.
- Do NOT assume file contents.
- Only modify the files I list.

---------------------------------------
FIX #1 — AdmissionUser & ApplicantUser
---------------------------------------
The models AdmissionUser.php and ApplicantUser.php were generated incorrectly.

Fix them so that BOTH of these models:

1. Extend:  Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable
2. Use:     Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable
3. Have correct $table and $primaryKey
4. Have proper $fillable fields (do NOT use guarded = [])
5. Hide password & remember_token
6. Are valid authentication providers for Laravel guards

DO NOT write your own structure — infer from each model’s existing fields and the database migrations in this project.

---------------------------------------
FIX #2 — config/auth.php
---------------------------------------
Update config/auth.php so Laravel knows about the 2 guards:

1. admission    → uses AdmissionUser model
2. applicant    → uses ApplicantUser model

Make sure:
- providers, guards, and passwords sections are correctly defined
- the default web guard still works
- no reference to the old User.php remains

---------------------------------------
FIX #3 — Remove unused User.php model
---------------------------------------
Delete app/Models/User.php ONLY if nothing references it anymore.
Double-check before deleting.

---------------------------------------
FIX #4 — Migrations sanity check
---------------------------------------
Inspect migrations to ensure:
- admission_users table matches AdmissionUser model
- applicant_users table matches ApplicantUser model
- password columns exist and use correct type
- remember_token exists where needed

If anything is missing, generate migration updates (do NOT delete or rewrite entire migrations).

---------------------------------------
DO NOT run migrations yet.
Just fix files.
---------------------------------------

When modifying the code:
- Maintain consistency with PostgreSQL column names and types.
- Confirm everything aligns with the DB schema we designed.

After all fixes, tell me what changed.
